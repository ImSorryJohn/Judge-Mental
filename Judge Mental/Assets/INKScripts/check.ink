Bailiff: All rise for Judge (player chosen name)!
Judge: Court is now in session! Andrew Colmanero, you are charged with murder and assault of multiple people using an ice cream spoon. How do you plead?

Andrew: Not guilty!

Judge: The evidence is quite strong.

Andrew: I am not guilty your honour! I promise! It's all a misunderstanding! I would never attack using a spoon! It's beneath me! Let me tell you what actually happened.

===At_The_Review_footage===

(You take a small DVD and put it into a player. A TV glitches to life and security footage from the restaurant plays. You watch as you see the friendly staff welcoming Andrew. Suddenly, he gets enraged, grabs a fork and stabs everyone in the eye.)

Judge: You were saying, Colmanero?

Andrew: I can explain!

Judge: Really? Then explain to me how that was different from what we were told!

Andrew: I used a fork, not a spoon! Spoons are just inferior! Yuck! Have you ever tried killing someone with a spoon? Very hard! Now a fork? That's where it's at!

===At_The_Listen===

Andrew: It was terrible your honour! Absolutely terrible!

Judge: Yeah, yeah, I'm sure it was, now get on with it!

Andrew: The day started normal! I woke up as the beautiful sunshine entered my room, watered my plants and petted my dog. After this, I realised that we were out of food! So of course, since I am such a caring and good person, I grabbed my last few funds and went to the restaurant to buy an ice cream for my dog!

Judge: For... Your dog?

Andrew: Yes, your honour! You see, my dog loves ice cream! And he was starving!

Judge: What about you?

Andrew: I was starving as well, but my dog was more important. Because love and friendship are what truly matters! So I went to the BigMonalds. Everything seemed normal at first, but then, when I ordered, I saw as the employeesâ€™ eyes lit up with a wicked sparkle! And then they attacked me! The ice cream machine was broken for months, and it requires a human sacrifice to work! And all the workers were like savage animals left to starve! They picked me up after and were about to put me on the grill when I grabbed a fork and was able to fight back! I managed to escape, but they framed me for murder. It was self defence your honour!

===At_The_Review_footage_1===

(You nod, taking into consideration what Andrew told you. You wonder if what he told you is true. But then you remember! You have footage! You take a DVD and then put it into a player. A small tv glitches to life and shows the security footage from the restaurant. Panicked, Andrew throws a fork at the tv, making it explode.)

Andrew Colmanero: Watch out! The footage is cursed by the satanic ice cream machine cult! I'm sorry your honour, but you can't watch it!
