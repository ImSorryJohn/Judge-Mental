Enraged by this, he picked one of the free plastic spoons and violently killed the staff. Before his sentence, he was interviewed by a local journalist. This is what he had to say: \"I will never trust ever again! Give me that ice cream!\" After this he attacked the poor man and stole his hard earned ice cream. The worst tragedy in the past month.","\n","ev","str","^Generic dialogue","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-0","flg":20},{"c-0":["\n",{"->":"At_the_Generic_dialogue"},{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"g-0":["done",{"#f":5}]}],"done",{"At_the_Generic_dialogue":[["^All rise for judge (player chosen name)!","\n","^Court is now in session!
